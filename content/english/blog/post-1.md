## **Kitchen layout**

Before starting repairs in an apartment or a private house, it is very important to decide on the layout. It is the same with the kitchen - planning plays a very important role here. It can be different depending on how the kitchen is placed in the kitchen. So, the main types of layouts are:
- **Straight.** This type of layout is not suitable for every kitchen. It is better to choose a direct kitchen only when your kitchen is long and large enough, since the entire kitchen set should be along one wall.
- **Corner.** One of the most common types of layouts for small square-shaped kitchens. In this case, the kitchen set is installed with the letter "G" along two walls. - Bar counter. This layout is perfect for one or two people. The bar counter in the kitchen is installed instead of the table, so for a large family this layout will be inconvenient. Also, the bar counter is a great way of zoning if you have a studio.
- **U-shaped.** This type of layout resembles the previous one, however, the bar counter here is not the main dining area, it is an addition to the kitchen set. This area can be used as a working area or as an additional dining area.
- **Island.** If your kitchen has a fairly large area, then you can think about installing an island. The island is installed in the middle of the room and serves as an additional work area or dining table. However, the island must be high enough, because bar stools must go to it.

## **How to organize space in the kitchen**

After we have decided on the layout, it is worth thinking about organizing the kitchen space. Convenience and comfort are very important in kitchens. This should guide the organization. Think about how to arrange everything so that your movements do not hinder anything, and all the kitchen content is where it is convenient to reach.

The kitchen is conditionally divided into the following zones: a place for preparing food, a place for washing, a place for cooking, a place where kitchen utensils are stored and a place where food is stored. It is very important to set these zones correctly.

> For example, food preparation areas can be multiple for added convenience. One of these zones must be placed between the sink and the stove. Another can be placed between the refrigerator and the sink, and another one behind the stove. Also make sure that there is enough light in these areas.

**The place for washing is the sink**. Above it should be a cabinet with a dryer - a special basket for wet dishes, from where water will drain. There should be a garbage place under the sink, as well as shelves for various household chemicals.

**Cooking area** can contain various appliances such as stove, oven and microwave, slow cooker, etc. Next to this area, it is advisable to place lockers where pots, pans and other utensils are stored in which food is prepared. Make sure all utensils are easy to reach and not too high or low.

Don't forget about **a place where kitchen utensils are stored**. Make sure there are enough cupboards and drawers to hold all your crockery.

**There are several places where products are stored**. These are a refrigerator, a freezer and lockers for storing cereals, bread, sweets, etc.

_In addition, it is important to take care of the correct distance between all lockers and zones. For example, there should be a minimum distance of 50 cm between the cabinets on which the work areas are located and the hanging cabinets. There should also be 50 cm between the sink and the stove. The total length of the surfaces in the preparation of products should be about one meter. And the optimal distance between the work area and the dining table is 90 cm._

Also make sure that all of your lockers will open freely without being hit by knobs or other cabinets.

## **How to choose a kitchen set**

Designs of a kitchen set are an important part in the interior of the kitchen. However, when looking at design ideas for a kitchen set, you need to take into account not only the appearance, but also the features of the materials.

Next, we talk about modern and beautiful designs of a kitchen set. You can also see beautiful kitchen photos of which we have attached to the article.

> The modern design of the kitchen set should match the overall interior of the room. It will always be a winning option to choose a kitchen set in the same style and color scheme as the kitchen decoration.

A stylish solution is kitchen furniture without handles (push to open). Such lockers open by pressing the front and fit perfectly into any kitchen interiors. However, in this case, it is better to choose matte furniture, since fingerprints will remain on the glossy one.

Quite a fashionable and interesting option - accenting with a bright color. The whole kitchen can be made in soothing basic colors, and kitchen furniture can have a bright color.

In addition, for the kitchen, we advise you to choose minimalist furniture without unnecessary details, because the kitchen is a place where there are always splashes of water, grease, food particles, etc. Therefore, it should be easy and quick to wash.

_Next, we’ll talk about how to choose colors for the kitchen so that they blend well with each other._

## **How to choose the right colors for your kitchen**

The selection of colors for the kitchen is a rather complicated process. It's not enough just to choose a few favorite colors and combine them, because not all colors are suitable for each other. Therefore, rash decisions can turn your kitchen into a circus.

It is also important to be aware of the visual impact of color on a room. We will talk about the basic rules for color combinations that will help make the kitchen sophisticated and interesting.

**Tip number 1.** A kitchen in light colors can visually enlarge the space, while a dark one can do the opposite.

**Tip #2.** Designers advise you to choose the color of furniture in the kitchen so that it matches the color of the finish or decor elements.

**Tip #3.** When using bright colors, combine them wisely. In order not to make a mistake, use the Itten color circle. Such a circle is divided into 12 colored sectors, the basis of which is red, yellow and blue. There are several ways to successfully combine colors:

- _**Complimentary** - a combination of contrasting colors (a certain color is combined with the one opposite, for example, red matches green)._
    
- _**Classical triad** - these are colors equidistant from each other, connecting which an equilateral triangle will come out. In the kitchen, the classic triad can be used by taking one color as a base, and others as accents._
    
- _**Analogue triad** - these are three colors that are next to each other in the circle of Itten._
    
There are a lot of such combination schemes, so feel free to look for the one that suits you, combine colors with each other and choose those colors and ideas for the kitchen that will be the perfect option for you.
